## Description of Project

Our project is based on a study conducted in collaboration with the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry. This investigation explores the intersection of COVID-19 and breast cancer (BC) in females, spanning the period from March 2020 to June 2021 in the United States. The primary focus is on addressing critical gaps in understanding, with a particular emphasis on underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.

The study encompasses a cohort of 1383 female participants diagnosed with breast cancer and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median age of participants is 61 years, and the follow-up period extends to 90 days. To ensure diversity and representation, the cohort includes individuals from various geographic regions within the United States.

Our primary objective is to comprehensively assess the severity of COVID-19 outcomes among females with a history of breast cancer. Leveraging the CCC19 registry, we aim to identify specific factors influencing COVID-19 severity in this particular population. This knowledge is crucial for tailoring medical responses and interventions for individuals with breast cancer who contract COVID-19.

## The questions we're going to answer are:
1. determining and examining outliers - Dean 
2. Does smoking have an affect on Covid with Breast Cancer on male and female - Mina
3. Does obesity and age have an affect on Covid with Breast Cancer on male and female - Fozia
4. How does race/ethnicity affect Covid with Breast Cancer on male and female - Shan
5. Area of Patients' residence vs Covid with Breast Cancer on male and female - Hamza
6. Alex Q here

## Limitations
1. Population Representation and Generalizability:
The sample size is relatively small and is limited to women from Germany and the USA, restricting the study's ability to provide a comprehensive representation of diverse populations. The uneven distribution across different groups within this subset introduces complexity, impeding the extrapolation of findings to a broader range of women.

2. Diminished Follow-Up Participation:
The decreasing number of participants retained for the follow-up survey leads to a gradual reduction in the sample size over time. The diminishing sample size throughout the study duration may impact the robustness of the conclusions drawn.

3. Scope of Variables:
The data primarily focuses on imaging-related procedures and outcomes, neglecting other potentially relevant variables such as lifestyle factors, comorbidities, or socioeconomic indicators that could contribute to a more comprehensive analysis. The absence of these variables may limit the study's ability to capture the multifaceted nature of factors influencing breast health and cancer detection.
