## Description of Project
This project talks about 
The Cancer Research Project is centered around a comprehensive study aimed at comparing the efficacy of abbreviated breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in detecting invasive breast cancer among women with dense breasts during routine screening. The data used for analysis, which is also employed in the above research, was gathered from a study conducted at 48 locations in the United States and Germany from December 2016 to November 2017. The study involved 1444 women aged 40 to 75 with either heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts.

During the study, participants underwent both abbreviated breast MRI and DBT, and the interpretations of these examinations were conducted independently to mitigate bias. The primary focus was on the invasive cancer detection rate, complemented by secondary outcomes encompassing sensitivity, specificity, the rate of additional imaging recommendations, and the positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsy.

The overarching goal of the project is to formulate screening guidelines and techniques. Additionally, the study delves into the correlation between the number of live births and the development of breast cancer. It seeks to investigate potential correlations related to age, genetic factors, family history, breast density, and demographic variables. This multifaceted approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of breast cancer risk factors and contribute valuable insights to screening practices.

## Limitations
1. Population Representation and Generalizability:
The sample size is relatively small and is limited to women from Germany and the USA, restricting the study's ability to provide a comprehensive representation of diverse populations. The uneven distribution across different groups within this subset introduces complexity, impeding the extrapolation of findings to a broader range of women.

2. Diminished Follow-Up Participation:
The decreasing number of participants retained for the follow-up survey leads to a gradual reduction in the sample size over time. The diminishing sample size throughout the study duration may impact the robustness of the conclusions drawn.

3. Scope of Variables:
The data primarily focuses on imaging-related procedures and outcomes, neglecting other potentially relevant variables such as lifestyle factors, comorbidities, or socioeconomic indicators that could contribute to a more comprehensive analysis. The absence of these variables may limit the study's ability to capture the multifaceted nature of factors influencing breast health and cancer detection.
