## Description of Project
This project talks about 
The Cancer Research Project is centered around a comprehensive study aimed at comparing the efficacy of abbreviated breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in detecting invasive breast cancer among women with dense breasts during routine screening. The data used for analysis, which is also employed in the above research, was gathered from a study conducted at 48 locations in the United States and Germany from December 2016 to November 2017. The study involved 1444 women aged 40 to 75 with either heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts.

During the study, participants underwent both abbreviated breast MRI and DBT, and the interpretations of these examinations were conducted independently to mitigate bias. The primary focus was on the invasive cancer detection rate, complemented by secondary outcomes encompassing sensitivity, specificity, the rate of additional imaging recommendations, and the positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsy.

The overarching goal of the project is to formulate screening guidelines and techniques. Additionally, the study delves into the correlation between the number of live births and the development of breast cancer. It seeks to investigate potential correlations related to age, genetic factors, family history, breast density, and demographic variables. This multifaceted approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of breast cancer risk factors and contribute valuable insights to screening practices.

## The questions we're going to answer are:
1. Looking at demographic factors like race, ethnicity, or age to see if there are any corelations with development of breast cancer
2. Fozia: Look at breast density or cup size and see if it had any correlation with development of breast cancer
3. Look at family history to see if there is a correlation with development of breast cancer
4. Look at genetic testing to see if women with certain genetic disorders are more likely to develope breast cancer
5. Look at the number of live births and see if there is a correlation with development of breast cancer
6. Comparing the two different screening techniques and seeing if any were associated with more adverse events
