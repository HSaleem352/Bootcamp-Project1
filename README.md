## Description of Project

Our project is based on a study conducted in collaboration with the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry. This investigation explores the intersection of COVID-19 and breast cancer (BC) in females, spanning the period from March 2020 to June 2021. The data encompasses a cohort of 1383 female participants diagnosed with breast cancer and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median age of participants is 61 years, and the follow-up period extends to 90 days. To ensure diversity and representation, the cohort includes individuals from various geographic regions within the United States.

Our primary objective is to comprehensively assess the severity of COVID-19 outcomes among females with a history of breast cancer. Leveraging the CCC19 registry, we aim to identify specific factors influencing COVID-19 severity in this particular population. This knowledge is crucial for tailoring medical responses and interventions for individuals with breast cancer who contract COVID-19.

## The questions we're going to answer are:
1. determining and examining outliers - Dean 
2. Does smoking have an effect on COVID severity on individuals with Breast Cancer? - Mina
3. Does obesity and age have an affect on Covid with Breast Cancer - Fozia
4. How does race/ethnicity affect Covid with Breast Cancer - Shan
5. Area of Patients' residence vs Covid with Breast Cancer - Hamza
6. How does the timing of their breast cancer treatment affect their Covid outcomes - Alex

## Code snippets


## Limitations
1. Vaccination status was not included in the study, as vaccines were not available during the predominant time frame for this cohort.
2. Confounding variables include drivers for inequity, such as socio-economic status, occupation, income, residence, education, and insurance status, limits insights into the root causes of disparities.
3. The study's focus on females and the United States may limit the generalizability of findings to other demographic groups or regions.
4. The dataset only focuses on 2 conditions, breast cancer and covid-19, so there could be other factors affecting covid-19 cases.
5. The data does not dive deeper into the history of smoking, rather generalizes if the subject smoked or not.
